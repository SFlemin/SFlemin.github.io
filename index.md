Hi there! 

Thank you for taking the time to look over my home projects. Here you will find a growing set of cybersecurity and networking ventures.



# Microsoft Sentinel Log Aggregation

Using Microsoft Azure, I ran a deliberately exposed Virtual Machine with RDP (port 3389) enabled. My aim was to detect remote login attempts and automate alerts through the Microsoft Sentinel SIEM tool. I set up the following log rules to automatically filter all events and set severity levels for each of them.

- Unsuccesful Logins (Medium)
- All Succssful Logins (Medium)

I was able to aggregate these remote login alerts from Azure Monitor Agent (transfering them to Sentinel) and tune alerts, displaying them in an easy to understand dashboard.

Using Cisco Packet Tracer, I created and customised both a home and office network using the neccesary networking devices.


 
# Certifications
A list of my current cybersecurity certificates.
## CompTIA Security+
* * *
The new CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) represents the latest and greatest in cybersecurity, covering the most in-demand skills related to current threats, automation, zero trust, IoT, risk – and more. Once certified, you’ll understand the core skills needed to succeed on the job – and employers will notice too. The Security+ exam verifies you have the knowledge and skills required to:

   Assess the security posture of an enterprise environment and recommend and implement appropriate security solutions.
   Monitor and secure hybrid environments, including cloud, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), and operational technology.
   Operate with an awareness of applicable regulations and policies, including principles of governance, risk, and compliance.
   Identify, analyze, and respond to security events and incidents.
