Hi there! 

Thank you for taking the time to look over my home projects. Here you will find a growing set of cybersecurity and networking ventures.



# Microsoft Sentinel Log Aggregation

Using Microsoft Azure, I ran a deliberately exposed Virtual Machine with RDP (port 3389) enabled. My aim was to detect remote login attempts and automate alerts through the Microsoft Sentinel SIEM tool. I set up the following log rules to automatically filter all events and set severity levels for each of them.

- Unsuccesful Logins (Medium)
- All Succssful Logins (Medium)

I was able to aggregate these remote login alerts from Azure Monitor Agent (transfering them to Sentinel) and tune alerts, displaying them in an easy to understand dashboard.

Using Cisco Packet Tracer, I created and customised both a home and office network using the neccesary networking devices.
